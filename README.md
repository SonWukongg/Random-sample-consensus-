# Random-sample-consensus-
In this notebook it contains code used to create a linear regression model on supervised data using Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC).
RANSAC, is an iterative method for estimating a mathematical model from a data set that contains outliers

In simple terms to use RANSAC:
1. Randomly selecting a subset of the data set
2. Fitting a model to the selected subset
3. Determining the number of outliers
4. Repeating steps 1-3 for a number of iterations
